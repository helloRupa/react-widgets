# React Widgets
Requires React, Babel, and Webpack

Includes weather (using Open Weather API), date/time, tabs, and autocomplete form.

## Open Weather API
Requires an API key that is not included in this repo. Once you get your own, store it in a file called constants.js at root level. In constants.js, create a POJO called keys and place your API key there under the key weather.
